The Loan Default Prediction System aims to assist banks in making informed lending decisions by predicting whether an applicant is likely to default on a loan before approval. 
The system features a role-based login for loan officers and managers, dynamic loan application forms, and backend machine learning integration. 
Using the RandomForestClassifier model, it analyzes inputs such as income, employment status, and credit history to predict defaults in car and gold loans, and approve or decline educational loans.
The manager dashboard provides application tracking, approval tools, and report generation to enhance efficiency and reduce financial risk.
